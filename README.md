# Housing Price Predictor

- Day 2 of my Machine Learning journey

- Small housing price predictor program I've written using Python and Scikit-learn.
- I'll use the California Housing Prices dataset that's built in to Scikit-learn
- My goal with this project is to understand supervised learning on a higher level.

- Project is finished. Each file does the function that it's named after.
